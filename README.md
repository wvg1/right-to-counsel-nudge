# Right to Counsel Nudge RCT
This repo enables analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of an informational nudge targeted at tenants facing an eviction hearing. Using documents in a (private) data folder, the scripts create outcome data using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and analyzes that data to demonstrate the effects of the treatment on case outcomes and tenant households.
