###this script creates paired lists of included and excluded document names to search for specific named documents while excluding others
###it relies on the doctype_search function and assumes that document names in the paired lists are in case-level folders
###working directory should be the main folder of the right-to-counsel-nudge repo, ensure folders and docs are in /data before running
